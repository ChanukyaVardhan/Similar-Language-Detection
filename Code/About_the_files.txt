project_train.txt - Complete Train Data initial
project_train_processed.txt - After 1)
train_new.txt - Final Train Data
validation_new.txt - Final Validation Data
i.txt - Validation Data for language i.
Features.txt - Contains features for all the languages after Stage 1.



1) First run this file
pre_process_input.py
	processes the initial train raw data.

2) Next run this file
train_validation.py
	Seperate Train and Validation Data

3) Next run this file
eachlang.py
	Seperates Validation data into seperate files for each language
	This generates i.txt for each language i i.e., all the validation data of each language goes into the that language numbered file.

4) Next run this file
word_count_language.py
	Form features by taking top thousand words(by tf idf score) and tests on validation data and writes feature vector into Features.txt

5) Use it to test the first stage model by giving an input file
grouping.py
	Reads the feature.txt file and gives the grouping for an input file

6) Next run this file
labels_data.py
	Write all the sentences of train data for all the languages which belong to a group into seperate files.

7) Next run this file for each group
svm.py
	generates the svm model and stores in result{i}_{vecsize}

8) Next run this file for each group to test the model
check.py
	reads the result files from 6) and predicts the final language for input file.

9) Next run this file
grouping_test.py
	This is useful for testing the data.
